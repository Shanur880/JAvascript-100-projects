<!-- HTML Structure: Defines a Tic-Tac-Toe game board using a <table> with clickable <td> elements. Each <td> has an id attribute that corresponds to its position on the board (cell00 to cell22).

JavaScript Variables:

board: Represents the game board as a 3x3 array initialized with empty strings ("").
currentPlayer: Tracks whose turn it is, starting with "X".
makeMove Function:

Usage: Triggered when a cell (<td>) is clicked.
Functionality:
Finds the clicked cell based on its row and column.
Checks if the selected cell is empty ("").
Updates the board array with the current player's mark (X or O).
Updates the UI to display the current player's mark in the clicked cell.
Checks for a win using the checkWin() function.
Displays a message if the current player wins or if it's a draw.
Switches turns to the next player (X to O or vice versa).
checkWin Function:

Usage: Called within makeMove to determine if the current player has won after making a move.
Functionality:
Defines winning patterns (rows, columns, diagonals) in a multidimensional array.
Checks each pattern to see if the current player (X or O) has marked all positions in any pattern.
Returns true if a winning pattern is found, otherwise false.
CSS Styling: Provides basic styling for the game board (table and td). -->
